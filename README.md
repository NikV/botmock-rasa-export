## Prerequisites

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12.x

```bash
#determine nodejs version
node --version
```

- [Rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/#quick-installation) installation

## Guide

To start, you will have to clone the repository, go into the directory,  and install the required dependencies for this script.

git clone git@github.com:Botmock/botmock-botframework-export.git

cd botmock-botframework-export

npm i
The next step is to go into folder and create a file called /.env , which will host your Botmock-based information. 

This file will contain some important information that will help the script extract the correct project from our API and run the export on it. Open the the .env file in your editor of choice.

You will need to setup the following variables in the file:

BOTMOCK_TOKEN="@YOUR-BOTMOCK-TOKEN"
BOTMOCK_TEAM_ID="@YOUR-BOTMOCK-TEAM-ID"
BOTMOCK_BOARD_ID="@YOUR-BOTMOCK-BOARD-ID"
BOTMOCK_PROJECT_ID="@YOUR-BOTMOCK-PROJECT-ID"

OUTPUT_DIR=optional/directory/for/output
To get your Botmock team ID you will need to visit http://app.botmock.com and login. Once logged in click on the "Teams" dropdown in the top bar and click on "Team Profile". 

- run `git clone git@github.com:Botmock/botmock-rasa-export.git`
- run `cd botmock-rasa-export`
- create `.env`
- edit `.env` to contain the following (with your own values filled in):
```bash
BOTMOCK_TEAM_ID=your-team-id
BOTMOCK_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
BOTMOCK_BOARD_ID=your-board-id
BOTMOCK_TOKEN=your-token

```
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- move `domain.yml` and `data/nlu.md` and `data/stories.md` to your Rasa project directory
- run `rasa train`
- run `rasa shell`
